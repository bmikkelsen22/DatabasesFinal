# Databases Final Project
This is our website for the final project in CS 340

## First time running
You will need to install the dependencies. In the `client/` directory, run `npm install`.

## How to compile TypeScript
First, navigate to the `client/` directory. To just build the client source once, run `npm run build`. To have Webpack watch the files while you're developing, run `npm run watch`. If Webpack is watching the files, you will just need to reload the file in your browser to see the changes.
